# Ruby-ReAct-Agent
An implementation of the ReAct approach to give LLMs access to external tools

I implemented the ReAct Pattern described in the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) in Ruby as a learning exercise.

To aide me in this project I closely followed and essentially ported over some python code written by [Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw) in his article [Python ReAct Pattern](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern)

Hope this sample code benefits someone in their own exploration of AI Agents in Ruby.

My goal is to expand on this and add the wikipedia search functionality to the agent.
