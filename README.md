# Ruby-ReAct-Agent ðŸ¤–
### An implementation of the ReAct approach to give LLMs access to external tools in ruby

<img width="150" alt="Image Generated by DALLÂ·E 2 with the prompt: Ruby Robot using tools in the style of basquiat" src="https://github.com/thedayisntgray/Ruby-ReAct-Agent/assets/4859128/09294617-4185-456e-a5c7-0ae9bf58aa96">

This is an implementation of the ReAct Pattern described in the paper [ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) in Ruby as a learning exercise.

To aide me in this project I closely followed and essentially ported over some python code written by [Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw) in his article [Python ReAct Pattern](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/python-react-pattern)

Hope this sample code benefits someone in their own exploration of AI Agents in Ruby.

#### To Run the file on mac make it an executable by running:

```chmod +x ruby-re-act.sh```

#### Create a file named .env copy over the contents of .env.example. Then replace with your OpenAI key.

```touch .env && cat .env.example > .env```


#### To execute the file type:

```./ruby-re-act.sh```
